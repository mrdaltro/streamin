#streamin 
Want to do a good platform for any video stream catalog.

<hr>

<b>What I am</b>

Just a project. Using C#, WinForms and XML (without databases), streamin wants to be a simple platform, where any user can do a XML list of your own video streams. With this, the amateur cinematography will have a free and organized place to allocate their works. 

This is an open project, and you can help me, collaborating and disclosing.

<b>Downloads! Where can I download it?</b>

It is a project under development, and while it isn't done, you can just help me doing codes, forking or cloning it (ya, I like to see my work as base for another).
